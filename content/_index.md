# LEV Linux
is a personally customized Void Linux distribution that focuses on
functionality and minimalism

#### The current version contains:
|                  |                |
| --------------   | ----------     |
| C Library        | musl           |
| Window manager   | DWM            |
| Status bar       | DWM Blocks     |
| Terminal         | ST             |
| Shell            | ZSH            |
| Lock screen      | SLock          |
| Browser          | QuteBrowser    |
| Document reader  | Zathura        |
| File manager     | NNN            |
| Image viewer     | SXIV           |
| Video player     | MPV            |

| Email client     | NeoMutt        |

| ***AND MORE***   | ***AND MORE*** |

**Note:** in the future there will be a *minimal* and a *functional* versions
both of which will contain fewer packages.
